    <h1>My favorite RTS Games</h1>
    <p>RTS games arent for everybody but definitely puts your skill set up to the test, they aren't entirely based on
      your luck but on your problem solving skills.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Generals</li>
      <li>Company of Heroes 2</li>
      <li>Civilization V</li>
    </ul>
